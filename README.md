**The library is under initial research and development. Release is planned for _2017_.**

Polydraw is a 2D vector graphics engine written in the Rust programming language for development of rich interactive applications and games.


**Currently the demos/examples work on the following combinations of operating systems and GPU platforms:**

| OS            | Subsystem     | Working             |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------------:|
| Windows       | WGL/OpenGL    | Yes                 |
| Windows       | DirectX       | No                  |
| Mac OS X      | Core OpenGL   | No                  |
| Linux         | EGL/OpenGL    | Yes                 |
| Linux         | GLX/OpenGL    | Yes                 |

During the upcoming phases of research and development we will post new demos and technical articles.
