PolyDraw is a very early work-in-progress high-quality 2D graphics library written in Rust.

Initial features will include:

* Custom 2D drawing algorithms (including shapes, curves and text)
* Highest quality anti-aliasing
* Sub-pixel LCD rasterization support
* Multithreaded CPU rasterization
* Linux, Windows and Mac OS X support

Alpha release is planned for Q2 of 2016.

An OpenCL GPU rasterization implmentation will follow after the initial release.
